## Scope

This library is designed for embedded systems. Security considerations include:
- No dynamic memory allocation in steady state (reduces attack surface)
- No network code (networking is out of scope)
- No persistent storage (no NVS side effects)
- Time functions are read-only (no system state modification)

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Always validate external inputs
- Use hardware watchdogs in production deployments
- Keep dependencies updated
